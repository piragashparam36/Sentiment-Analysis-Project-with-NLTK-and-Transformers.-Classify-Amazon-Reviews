Sentiment Analysis Project with NLTK and Transformers: Classifying Amazon Reviews

In this project, I developed a system to analyze Amazon reviews by reading both star ratings and text content. The system uses two approaches:

VADER with NLTK: Utilized the VADER sentiment tool from the NLTK library for rule-based sentiment classification.

RoBERTa Transformer: Implemented the RoBERTa transformer, fine-tuned on Twitter data, for more precise sentiment analysis.

The system categorizes reviews into positive, neutral, or negative sentiments based on the star ratings and text. It can then find and sort reviews according to these categories, making it easier to access relevant feedback.
